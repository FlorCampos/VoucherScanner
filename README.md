# 📸 Voucher Scanner

Streamlit app that captures or uploads a photo of a voucher/receipt, extracts its data with **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (vision + structured outputs), and automatically logs it to a **Google Sheets** spreadsheet.

## Architecture (Phase 1)

```
Image (camera / upload)
        │
        ▼
Gemini 2.5 Flash  ──  response_schema = Voucher (Pydantic)
        │
        ▼
Voucher (validated object)
        │
        ▼
Google Sheets (gspread + google-auth)
```

- **OCR/Extraction**: `google-genai`, model `gemini-2.5-flash`, with `response_mime_type="application/json"` and `response_schema=Voucher`. The model is forced to return JSON that satisfies the `Voucher` Pydantic schema; if it doesn't, `response.parsed` is `None` and the app treats it as an explicit error (no manual text parsing).
- **Persistence**: `gspread.service_account_from_dict(...)`, authenticated with `google-auth` (not `oauth2client`, which is deprecated).
- **Secrets**: managed exclusively via `st.secrets` (Streamlit secrets), never files on disk.

## Local setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # to run tests:
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
3. Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (this file is in `.gitignore`, never committed). You can store `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` either as a TOML table or as a raw JSON string:
   ```toml
   GEMINI_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key"

   [GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS]
   type = "service_account"
   project_id = "..."
   private_key = """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   ...
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----"""
   client_email = "..."
   token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
   # ...remaining fields from the downloaded JSON key
   ```
   - `GEMINI_KEY`: API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
   - `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`: the full Google Cloud service account JSON, with **Editor** access to the target spreadsheet (share the sheet with the service account's `client_email`). Paste the downloaded JSON file's values as-is — avoid retyping the `private_key` by hand, since a single dropped or altered character breaks the PEM.
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Covers the `Voucher` schema (required fields/type validation) and the `extraer_datos_voucher` function (mocking the Gemini client, no real API calls).

## Security

- No secret lives in the repository. `credentials.json` and `.streamlit/secrets.toml` are excluded via `.gitignore`.
- If a service account key is ever exposed on disk or in a commit, **rotate it immediately** from Google Cloud Console (IAM → Service Accounts → Keys) — don't wait for confirmation that it was actually leaked.

## Roadmap (upcoming phases)

- **Phase 2 — Robustness**: retries with backoff for transient Gemini API errors; image size/validation limits before sending to the model; rate-limit handling.
- **Phase 3 — Observability**: structured (JSON) logging sent to an external system (e.g. Cloud Logging) instead of just `st.error`; extraction success-rate metrics.
- **Phase 4 — Data scalability**: migrate from Google Sheets to a database (Postgres/SQLite) behind a service layer, keeping Sheets as an optional view/export.
- **Phase 5 — Multi-user**: user authentication in the app and per-user sheet/record separation.
